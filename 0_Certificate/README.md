(b) Cisco NDG linux Certificate :
    In this course i learned the basics of Linux Operating system. I already had practical knowledge of 
    linux O.S because i used approx three years, but now happy to have also the theoretical knowledge 
    of Linux with implementation. I learned in this course to run Terminal, and many commands for the 
    linux like, mv command for move, cp command for copy, rm for remove, cd foldername to enter the directory,
    cd .. to go back to previous directory and many more implementations like for running .c file,
    we use gcc filename.c, then we can get the output in terminal by command ./a.out.
